__Diabetes Prediction__ Objective of this project is to diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has diabetes based on certain diagonostic measurements. All patients are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage. Skills: data exploration, regression modeling

__House Price Prediction__ Built several linear regression models including lasso, ridge, or ElasticNet and trained them with the training set. Used k-fold cross-validation to select the best hyperparameters. Skills: data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, regression modeling, cross validation

__Heart Disease Detection__ Compared accuracies of decision tree classifier to random forest. Built the best decision tree I could. Then, I tried to match with the simplest random forest that can be built.

__Life Expectancy__ Exploratory data analysis on factors that affect life expectancy. Specifically, which factors increase the expected life in the countries and which factors decrease it. Skills: exploratory data analysis, data cleaning, univariate and multivariate exploration, feature engineering, PCA

__World Happiness__
