Noteable Thinkful projects: 

* __Credit Card Fraud Detection__ Worked with a large dataset of 280k+ transactions and used logistic regression, decision tree classifier, and gradient boosting classifier compare model performance at detecting fraudulent transactions

__Diabetes Prediction__ Objective of this project is to diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has diabetes based on certain diagonostic measurements. All patients are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage. Skills: data exploration, regression modeling

__House Price Prediction__ Built several linear regression models including lasso, ridge, or ElasticNet and trained them with the training set. Used k-fold cross-validation to select the best hyperparameters. Skills: data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, regression modeling, cross validation

__Heart Disease Detection__ Compared accuracies of decision tree classifier to random forest. Built the best decision tree I could. Then, I tried to match with the simplest random forest that can be built.

__Life Expectancy__ Exploratory data analysis on factors that affect life expectancy. Specifically, which factors increase the expected life in the countries and which factors decrease it. Skills: exploratory data analysis, data cleaning, univariate and multivariate exploration, feature engineering, PCA

__Recipe Rating Prediction__ Used ingredient and keyword list to predict the rating of recipes while testing SVM Regressor vs SVC Classifier

__Social Survey Partner Cohabitation Prediction__ Used social survey data to predict whether or not someone lives with their partner. Improved error rate of model by testing different strategies such as changing the loss function, increasing iterations, and maximum depth
